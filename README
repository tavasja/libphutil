The "libphutil" library is no longer distributed as a standalone library.
Instead, it is now bundled with "Arcanist" and "Phabricator".

For more information, see <https://phurl.io/u/libphutil>.

If you are a normal user of Phabricator or Arcanist, you can delete the
"libphutil/" directory.

If you are a developer who has code with dependencies on "libphutil/",
update your dependencies to point at "arcanist/" or "phabricator/" as
appropriate.
